<h2>Part 1: Questions A</h2><br>    
<ul>
    <li>a) An alert box is opened, stating "undefined". This is because variables have no type until data is placed in them. </li>
    <li>b) An alert box is opened, stating "false". This is because the text in parenthesis refers to the boolean value "false". </li>
    <li>c) An alert box is opened, stating "1". This is because 7%2 refers to the modulo operation, depicting the remainder left over after dividing 7 by 2. </li>
    <li>d) An alert box is opened, stating "Jim Smith". This is because the variable "name" is concatinated onto the string containing the last name.</li>
    <li>e) An alert box is opened, stating "52". The variable containing 5 is a string varible due to how it was given the value, so adding 2 to it just places the 2 character on the end of the string.</li>
 </ul>

  <h2>Part 2: Questions B</h2><br>  
    
 <ul>
    <li>1. Java is an object-based programming language that must be compiled and is used for a variety of different things, while JavaScript is primarily associated with web development in conjunction with HTML. JavaScript also is interpreted as plain-text code rather than requiring compilation.</li>
     <li>2. the "+" operator is used to either add values together, such as multiple number values, or to combine strings. ++ is used to increment values by 1. </li>
     <li>3. window.alert opens a small alert box inside the browser, displaying text as directed. document.write prints text directly to the webpage. console.log passes the text or variable to be printed in the website's console.</li>
     <li>4. = is used to set a variable to a certain value. == is a conditional comparing two variables, but this ignores the data type, so 5 and "5" would be considered the same. === is the same as ==, but it takes into account data type.</li>
     <li>5. while loops and do while loops both will repeat their code until a certain condion is no longer met. However, do while loops will run once without checking if the condition is true, while while loops will check the contion up front.</li>
</ul>

    <script>
    var name = prompt("Enter your first name");
    var name2 = name.toUpperCase();
    document.write("Welcome "+name2+"!<br>");
    document.write("Welcome "+name2+"!<br>");
    document.write("Welcome "+name2+"!<br>");
